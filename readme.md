# Sportradar Scoreboard Library

This is a straightforward library developed for the Sportradar coding exercise.
### Areas for Future Enhancement:
* Expanded Test Coverage: Implement additional test cases for the Scoreboard class.
* Improved Error Handling: Implement checks and appropriate responses for potential errors in various functions.
* Had problems getting mockito-inline to work, so ended up pasing a Clock object from test case to match class.
